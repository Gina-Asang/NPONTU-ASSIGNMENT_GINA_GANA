HEALTH CHECK ANALYSIS

A simple web service that monitors 3 endpoints from 2 servers and exposes their health status
via a /health endpoint.

METRICS MONITORED

1. Status (UP/DOWN)
   Immediate visibility into whether users can access the service.

2. Response Time 
  this matters because it serves as an early warning system. Slow responses often indicate 
issues that could lead to complete failure.

3. HTTP Status Code
   shows diagnostic information. Different codes (404, 500, 503 etc) 
   point to different types of problems and  require different fixes.

4. Error Details
   it shows specific troubleshooting information. "Connection failed" ,
   "Timeout" which can tell engineers exactly what and where  to investigate.

5. Overall System Health
Shows whether we have partial or complete system

What Happens when one service goes down
- Detection within 5 seconds (service timeout)
- /health endpoint immediately reflects the failure
- Specific error message shows what went wrong
- Overall status changes from "healthy" to "degraded"
- Engineers can see exactly which service failed and why

How to detect in production;

Monitor setup:
- Configure monitoring tools to call /health every 30 seconds
- Watch for changes in overall_status from "healthy"
- Track response time trends for early warnings

Alert Syestem configuration:
- Immediate alerts when overall_status becomes "degraded" or "down"
- Warning alerts when response times exceed thresholds
- Notifications for any individual endpoint status changes

A possible response workflow for the health system checker:

1. Monitoring systems detects failure 
2. An alert sent to an engineer 
3. Engineer checks /health for specific failure details
4. The team investigates and fixes the issue
5. After Fixing checks if status returns to "healthy"
